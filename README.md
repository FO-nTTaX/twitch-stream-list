twitch-stream-list
==================

This is an easy example of how to put in a stream list on a homepage.

The file index.html is a very easy example of how to do a streamlist. 
As it is in this repository, each file is in the same folder, and if you want to put the files into different folders, you will have to change the includes. The php part is very simple, all the work is done in the javascript part. 

The javascript part relies on jQuery, so be sure to include it.

I do not guarantee that this will work everywhere and forever, but it worked for me and i hope it will be helpful for someone.
